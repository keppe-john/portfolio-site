   <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! With over 30 years of experience across retail, administration, and customer-centered roles, I'm now channeling my energy into the world of technology. I’m passionate about learning new tools, sharpening my digital skills, and exploring opportunities where service, creativity, and tech intersect. This portfolio reflects both where I’ve been and where I’m headed—and I’m excited about what’s next.</p>

    <h2>My Journey Into Tech</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm John. I come from a background in customer service and administrative support, where problem-solving, communication, and organization were part of my everyday routine. After years of helping people navigate complex systems and keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes, I found myself drawn to web development as a new way to build and support tools for others.</p>

    <h3>Bridging People and Technology</h3>
    <p>Whether it was managing schedules, assisting customers, or coordinating details, my administrative experience taught me how to think ahead and plan with care. Now I apply that same mindset to coding—writing clean, responsive HTML and CSS that feels intuitive to real users.</p>

    <h3>Why Vaporwave?</h3>
    <p>I’ve always been inspired by the nostalgic, surreal aesthetic of vaporwave—its mix of retro tech and dreamy color. I see web design as a form of expression: not just pixels, but stories. My portfolio blends that visual style with thoughtful functionality, one page at a time.</p>

    <h3>Always Learning</h3>
    <p>This site is a reflection of my learning journey. I'm building it with sincerity, curiosity, and a whole lot of late-night Googling. I'm proud of what I've learned—and even more excited about what comes next.</p>
